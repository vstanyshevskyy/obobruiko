          I met Olesia during our first session, and I immediately knew I wanted
          to continue working with her. Olesia listens not only to what you say
          but also to what you're thinking. She picks up on subtle cues and
          brings them back for us to discuss together.


          After each session, I always come away with new ideas, insights, and thoughts that hadn't occurred to me before. It feels like I'm brainstorming and creating new perspectives while talking to her.


          With Olesia, you know you'll receive the help you need to untangle the thoughts stuck in your mind.


          I also appreciate that she is constantly learning and sharing new knowledge. I highly recommend her as a psychologist for both professional and personal matters.

          I had the pleasure of working with Olesia, who guided me in gaining
          valuable insights about myself. Olesia's professional approach, adept
          questioning, and practical exercises & homework at the end of each
          session were instrumental in helping me achieve my goals.


          Her empathy, patience, and understanding fostered a supportive environment where I felt at ease. Olesia's kind energy truly contributes to a sense of peace throughout the sessions. Therefore, without hesitation, I would recommend Olesia to anyone seeking personal development and striving to become the best version of themselves. Her expertise and compassionate guidance make her an invaluable resource in the journey of self-discovery and growth.

        text: There are no words to describe how grateful I am for guidance and help I
          received from Olesia during our work! She has always been a
          professional in a various areas, from self esteem problems to work
          ethics and from relationships to coping with anxiety.  Ultimately
          understanding person, she lead me from feeling like the only weirdo on
          this planet to becoming a fairly confident woman that finally feels
          safe in life.
