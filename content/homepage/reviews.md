        text: Working with Olesia has been a game-changer for me. She helped me
          re-evaluate situations I used to see as negative and taught me how to
          turn them into positives. Her approach is compassionate and
          insightful, and she really takes the time to understand you. I’ve
          gained so much clarity and confidence from our sessions. She’s easy to
          talk to and always makes you feel heard and supported. I can't thank
          her enough for the positive impact she's had on my life. If you’re
          looking for someone who truly cares and can make a difference, I
          highly recommend her!

          I met Olesia during our first session, and I immediately knew I wanted
          to continue working with her. Olesia listens not only to what you say
          but also to what you're thinking. She picks up on subtle cues and
          brings them back for us to discuss together.


          After each session, I always come away with new ideas, insights, and thoughts that hadn't occurred to me before. It feels like I'm brainstorming and creating new perspectives while talking to her.


          With Olesia, you know you'll receive the help you need to untangle the thoughts stuck in your mind.


          I also appreciate that she is constantly learning and sharing new knowledge. I highly recommend her as a psychologist for both professional and personal matters.

          I felt very comfortable with Olesia from the very beginning, even
          though the session was not in my native language. I felt heard and at
          ease to express myself. She is very attentive, sensitive, and
          empathetic, while also being objective and direct.




          Additionally, she recommended readings that helped me expand my perspective on the situation I was experiencing. I was able to view it from the outside and felt more empowered regarding it. By the end of the sessions, I felt happier, heard, and stronger. Thank you :)

          so many insights and hope, which wouldn’t have been possible without
          her. Olesia was always very supportive and mindful. I also really
          enjoyed her approach, which is based on structure and knowledge.
          Olesia made me feel comfortable and safe and helped me find more peace
          and clarity regarding my emotions and thoughts. She is a strong
          specialist and a wonderful person. It’s a delight for me to know and
          learn from her!
