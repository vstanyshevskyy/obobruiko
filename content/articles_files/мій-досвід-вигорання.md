      > «Вигорання? Це не про мене» - думала я.


      Поки не захворіла на ГРВІ тричі за два місяці. Поки не помітила, що до середи вже втомлююсь працювати, стало важко сконцентруватись, з’явилася забудькуватість (одного разу машину забула закрити), легше дратуюсь, більше тривожусь, гірше сплю, прокрастиную і не маю сил та бажання пробувати щось нове.


      За захопленням від роботи, я **довгий час не помічала втоми**. Забула як це відпочивати і не думати про роботу. А без якісного відпочинку ставало все важче і важче працювати.


      Так я застрягла у циклі вигорання.


      ## Як я вибиралась звідти?


      1. Зробила собі відпустку, у моєму випадку, коли вже страждало фізичне здоров’я, без цього було не обійтись.

      2. Пріоритезувала сон, почала лягати до 23-ї і всі розваги та посиденьки з друзями намагаюсь завершувати до 21:30. Відверто говорю про те, коли хочу завершити (Новий рік, то був виняток). За 2 години до сну вимикаю яскраве біле світло, в хід ідуть теплі нічники і торшерчики. Усі екрани переведені в нічний режим. Провітрюю спальню, вдягаю маску для сну і беруші. Бо **три базові умови для якісного сну – це темнота, тишина і прохолода**. У вихідні намагаюсь вставати до 9-ї, але можу і полежати в ліжечку, якщо цього потребую. 

      3. Живу за принципом – **«втомилася, відпочинь»**. Роблю «привали» посеред дня, щоб полежати на диванчику, обійняти чоловіка, глянути смішні відео, погратися з котом, зробити чайок, помедитувати, полити квіти і т.д.

      4. Завершую усі робочі справи (консультації, супервізії, навчання, створення постів, сторіс) до 18:00, **навіть якщо не встигла зробити щось із запланованого**. Не беру нових навчань, якщо не вистачає сил.

      5. Я не дуже люблю фізичні вправи, але без них я сонна і зла. Раніше змушувала себе бігати, але то не моє. Знайшла для себе улюблені асани з йоги і трішки зарядки, **усього 15-20 хв зранку**, цього якраз достатньо для виділення серотоніну. Одного разу, замість вправ, чоловік запропонував пограти в твістер, то я вам скажу не гірше асан. Щодня виходжу на прогулянку мінімум на 30 хв, не користуюсь ліфтом, ходжу коли говорю по телефону. Іноді чищу зуби, стоячи на одній нозі (асана на баланс). А влітку зацінила велосипед.

      6. **Додала різноманіття**: почала ходити в нові заклади і готувати нові рецепти, дякуючи чоловіку. Навчилась (ну це голосно сказано) грати в покер і манчкін, дякуючи подругам. Купила різні квіти. Дозволила собі експериментувати зі стилем. Нарешті повісили з чоловіком годівничку для птахів, не пройшло й чотирьох років. Побачила ретропотяг. І загалом стало більше спонтанності.

      7. Більше проводжу часу з людьми, з якими почуваюсь добре і мінімізувала спілкування з тими, хто висмоктує сили. Відкритіша до спілкування з новими людьми.

      8. Роблю **інформаційний детокс**: у вихідні дні не беру з собою телефон (довелось сертифікат про вакцинацію скинути чоловіку), рідко читаю новини, позитиву там не дуже, а тривожних текстів достатньо. Якщо втомлена і маю пропущені дзвінки, то пишу, що зателефоную пізніше, якщо це не щось термінове.


      Ось такий він, мій рецепт «розгорання». А який у вас? Як ви справляєтесь з вигоранням і додаєте собі ресурсів?

      > "Burnout? Not me," I thought, dismissing the idea entirely. I was driven
      by passion, convinced my enthusiasm made me immune.


      And then, my body, in its infinitely patient way, began to send me signals. Not gently, but with a series of increasingly insistent nudges. Three colds in two months. Exhaustion by Wednesday. My focus blurred, and I started forgetting things, like locking my car. An unfamiliar irritability simmered, feeding a constant, low hum of worry. Sleep became a restless battle. My desire to try anything new simply vanished, replaced by a suffocating blanket of procrastination.


      For too long, my boundless enthusiasm had blinded me to the insidious creep of exhaustion. I’d forgotten how to truly switch off, how to simply be without the constant mental hum of tasks. Without that vital space to recharge, the very work I loved transformed into a monumental, soul-crushing effort. That’s precisely how I tumbled, headfirst, into the unforgiving churn of the burnout cycle.


      This wasn't just a rough patch; it was a blaring alarm. I had to understand what was happening. So, I dove in – into professional courses, into research, into every piece of information I could find. What I discovered changed everything. I gained invaluable insights into what burnout truly is, how to navigate its treacherous waters, and, crucially, how to prevent it from ever taking hold again. Ready to explore it together?

      ### What is Burnout?


      As I grappled with the pervasive exhaustion and mental fog, I desperately needed a name for this invading force. That's when I discovered the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of [burnout syndrome](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases): an individual's **"response to long-term stress at work that has not been successfully managed."**


      It struck me with a chilling accuracy. The WHO clarifies that burnout isn't a medical condition or mental disorder, which brought a strange relief. Yet, they also highlighted its profound **damage across cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral levels**. I recognized it all: the creeping negativity, the constant emotional drain, my body's utter fatigue, and my growing dread toward colleagues and clients. It shadowed every aspect of my professional role, once a source of meaning.

      ### **The Genesis of Burnout: From Fiction to Fact**


      Interestingly, the word "burnout" wasn't always in our vocabulary. It first surfaced in [Graham Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene)'s 1961 novel, [“A Burnt-Out Case”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Burnt-Out_Case), describing an architect who found neither meaning in his profession nor pleasure in life.


      Years later, American psychologist [Herbert Freudenberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Freudenberger) gave the term clinical weight. Observing himself and the volunteer staff at a free clinic for people with drug use issues, he precisely defined **[burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout)** as a state of **exhaustion, fatigue, and frustration** stemming from work's excessive demands. He noted clear physical symptoms like headaches and sleeplessness, alongside psychological tolls: a "quickness to anger" and a "closed thinking" that resisted new ideas. 


      - - -


      ### Burnout symptoms and signs


      Burnout isn’t just tiredness. It’s a deeper exhaustion that no weekend off or good night’s sleep can fully fix.


      It can show itself in many ways, but three core signs reveal burnout:


      * **Emotional and physical exhaustion**

      * **Cynicism, negativity, or disconnection from your work**

      * **A reduced sense of professional efficacy**


      So, how can you tell if you or someone close to you is experiencing burnout? Watch for these signs:


      #### Exhaustion


      This is often the first and clearest sign of burnout: a deep, relentless fatigue that no amount of rest seems to fix. You may feel like you’re running on empty – emotionally and physically. Tasks that once felt simple now feel overwhelming. By the end of the workday, you’re drained. And by morning, you’re already dreading what’s ahead.


      Burnout doesn’t just steal your energy – it gradually wears down your self-control. You might find yourself snapping over small things, spending impulsively, or reaching for quick comforts like food, alcohol, or anything that offers a temporary escape.


      Your body and mind will try to warn you. Pay attention to low mood, rising anxiety, unexplained aches, stomach or bowel issues, and difficulty concentrating. These aren’t minor complaints – they’re red flags. You're not just tired. You’re exhausted. You’re burning out.


      #### **Cynicism, negativity or disconnection from your work**


      This often follows exhaustion and is another clear sign of burnout. You may notice your interest and enthusiasm for work fading. Tasks that once felt meaningful might now seem dull or pointless.


      You might find yourself growing impatient or irritable with coworkers, clients, or customers. Social interactions at work may feel like a burden, and you prefer to keep to yourself.


      Negative thoughts can creep in — cynical jokes or remarks about your job, colleagues, or even yourself become more common.


      You may start feeling dissatisfied with the results of your work, questioning its value or your own contribution.


      #### Reduced professional efficacy


      This is often the final chapter in the story of burnout. Tasks that once seemed straightforward now drag on endlessly, as if time itself has slowed. Problem-solving feels like wandering a maze with no exit, and your connection to the organization’s goals begins to fade, leaving you to wonder why you’re even trying.


      Quiet but persistent doubts gnaw at you – questioning your skill, your effectiveness, your very worth. No matter how hard you work, that sense of accomplishment slips further away, like a shadow just beyond reach.


      This isn’t just a bad day or a moment of weakness. It’s a clear sign burnout has taken root – and it’s time to pay attention.


      And it doesn’t stop there...

      ### The Consequences of Burnout


      Burnout doesn’t just quietly disappear if you ignore it. The longer you push through without tending to what’s really hurting you, the more it takes – not just your energy, but your clarity, joy, sense of purpose, and eventually, your health.


      When you’re burned out, your ability to keep up with the demands of your job begins to falter. And then, bit by bit, the impact spreads – into your relationships, mood, and ability to find meaning in things that once mattered deeply to you.


      #### What It Can Do to Your Mind


      Burnout doesn’t just drain your energy – it clouds your entire inner world. Slowly and quietly, it unravels the threads of how you think, feel, and respond to life.


      Researchers have linked burnout to a wide range of mental health effects. Your focus might start to slip. Memory becomes unreliable. Even small decisions can feel overwhelming. You may find yourself more anxious, more irritable, more easily rattled than usual.


      It can also bring deeper emotional shifts – a lingering sadness you can’t explain, a sense of dissatisfaction with life, and that gnawing voice in your head whispering you’re not doing enough, or worse, that you’re not enough. Your confidence shrinks. And you begin to feel like you’re constantly failing – no matter how hard you try.


      In the most serious cases, some studies have even linked burnout to a significant suicide risk. That’s not something to brush off. It’s a wake-up call – not to panic, but to pay attention.


      Because none of this means you’re weak. It means you’re human. And you’ve been carrying too much, for too long, without enough care or support.


      ![Picture "Red Balloon" by Paul Klee](/assets/uploads/red-balloon-by-paul-klee.jpg "“Red Balloon” by Paul Klee (1922). Klee's home was ransacked by the Gestapo, he was fired from Düsseldorf Academy and many of his paintings were seized. In 1933 he began suffering with a painful illness, yet he managed to produce more than 1000 works during his final years, many dealing with his personal stress. Klee used the process of making art as meditation, saying that it helped him to live in an 'intermediate world'. A phenomenon known as 'Post-Traumatic Growth' is where people who have suffered extreme stress use the experience to enhanced appreciate life and also learn to embrace new opportunities, cultivating inner strength through the knowledge that they have overcome tremendous hardship.

      #### What It Can Do to Your Body


      Burnout doesn’t just live in your head – it takes a toll on your body, too. Slowly, and sometimes without you even noticing, it begins showing up in places you never expected.


      Several studies show that people with higher levels of burnout are more likely to experience physical troubles you might not immediately connect to exhaustion, like muscle pain, stomach issues, headaches, and cardiovascular disorders. Your immune system can feel fragile, leaving you vulnerable to infections. Nights grow restless, fatigue becomes chronic, and waking up feeling refreshed turns into a distant dream.


      Research reveals that burnout pushes your body into a state of constant stress, flooding it with cortisol – a stress hormone that, when elevated for too long, can increase the risk of serious health problems like type 2 diabetes.


      But it’s not the same for everyone. Symptoms can look very different from person to person – and that’s what makes burnout so slippery, and why it’s so often overlooked.


      No matter how it shows up, your body isn’t betraying you. It’s trying to protect you. It’s asking for your attention, your care, and your compassion.


      #### What It Can Do to Your Behavior


      Burnout doesn’t just affect how you feel inside – it can change how you act, too. You might find yourself feeling unhappy or dissatisfied with your work, losing the interest or commitment you once had. Sometimes, burnout leads to frequent absences or showing up but struggling to really focus on your tasks because your health is taking a hit.


      You might catch yourself thinking about quitting or notice that you’re not able to work as effectively as you used to. Maybe you feel more irritable or even aggressive toward coworkers or clients – little things that wouldn’t have bothered you before suddenly feel overwhelming.


      Some people turn to unhealthy habits to cope, like drinking more alcohol, smoking, or using drugs. In rare cases, burnout can even lead to misusing company resources or stealing, as a sign of how desperate someone feels.


      These behaviors are signals – not flaws. They’re your mind and body trying to tell a story that something needs to change.

      ### The causes of burnout


      Two primarily categories that can trigger burnout are *organizational* and *individual* factors. 


      > **Key point:** burnout is more a result of workplace conditions than individual characteristics. Although organizational factors are capable per se of generating burnout, individual factors would play a moderating role.


      ![Picture "The Escape Ladder" by Joan Miró](/assets/uploads/the-escape-ladder-by-joan-miro.png "“The Escape Ladder” by Joan Miró (1940). Miró became an accountant to please his parents, but the stress of being in a career that he disliked proved too much; art helped him to become self-aware and to understand his thought processes. Whatever the cause of the stress, by visualising personal thought processes objectively, one can learn to take more control. Albricht-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, USA © Successió Miró/ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2022. Bridgeman Images.")


      #### Organizational factors


      Usually, the type of work you do, how it's organized, and how you get along with your coworkers, supervisors, and/or clients can all be potential triggers or risk factors for burnout.


      ##### Work overload


      Having too much work, both in quantity and complexity, requires significant effort and can make you feel exhausted and stressed out. It might even make you want to distance yourself from work to protect yourself from feeling even worse.


      ##### Poor working hours


      A work schedule that hinders your work-life balance is another trigger of burnout, especially when dealing with: *shift work, frequent rotations, night shifts, extended working* hours or *excessive overtime.*


      Additionally, these demanding schedules are linked to *sleep disorders, heart issues,* *health complaints, job dissatisfaction, decreased attention* and *performance*, and an increased *risk of accidents*.


      ##### Emotional labor


      > *Imagine a situation when Hannah that works at customer support soothes an angry client who is not satisfied with their purchase. This is an example of emotional labor – the process of managing your feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of your job.* 


      Employees often need to control their emotions when interacting with customers, coworkers, and managers. This means suppressing feelings like anger, irritation, or discomfort to follow company guidelines. It also involves expressing emotions that might not be genuine, such as showing sympathy to clients or smiling to coworkers. Sometimes, it means appearing calm even when feeling scared.


      Dealing with emotional labor often means handling extra stress at work. Several studies have found strong connections between emotional labor and burnout, particularly in fields like teaching and human resources.


      ##### Lack of autonomy and influence at work


      Lack of freedom at in how you do your job, and the inability to influence decisions that affect your work are linked to increased burnout. On the flip side, having autonomy and control over your work can lower burnout levels and increase professional satisfaction.


      ##### Ambiguity and role conflict


      When you're not sure what's expected of you or your role isn't clear enough, or when your tasks clash or create conflicting demands, burnout level increases.


      ##### Incompetent supervision and unfair treatment


      Overly controlling and unjust supervision, fixated solely on mistakes without acknowledging achievements and efforts, or the opposite – complete lack of direction or having no clear leadership at all, increases the likelihood of burnout. 


      On the other hand, when employees are treated fairly, it leads to an increase in available resources, which helps to reduce emotional exhaustion and lowers the risk of burnout.


      ##### Lack of social support


      Lack of support from colleagues or supervisors at work, along with internal conflicts among coworkers, can trigger burnout. Conversely, having social support acts as a buffer against this syndrome.


      #### Individual factors


      ##### Personality traits


      Your personality affects how you perceive work environment, how you cope and manage with work demands and resources.


      One popular model of personality is [the Big Five](https://bigfive-test.com) model. This model represents five major personality traits that you can remember using OCEAN acronym:


      * **\*O**penness *vs.* closedness to experience* 

      * **\*C**onscientiousness *vs.* lack of direction*

      * **\*E**xtraversion *vs.* introversion*

      * **\*A**greeableness *vs.* antagonism*

      * **\*N**euroticism *vs.* emotional stability*


      Several studies conclude that personality traits in the Big Five model are significantly and differently associated with burnout. 


      **Openness to experience** means you're *curios* about both *inner* and *outer* *worlds*, *creative*, have *active imagination*, *wide interests* and *willingness to consider new ideas*. If you score high on openness it will be a protective factor against burnout as it is positively associated with the professional efficacy component of burnout and negatively associated with job disconnection.


      Likewise, **conscientiousness** that describes *careful, organized, thorough, efficient, self-disciplined* and *determined* person, reduces the likelihood of burnout.


      If you're more of an **extravert** – *sociable, outgoing, energetic, adventurous* and *enthusiastic* – consider yourself lucky as extraversion is another personality trait that protects you against burnout.


      Similarly, if you're more-**agreeable** person who is *altruistic, trustful, sympathetic* to others and *eager to help* them, you will tend to experience less burnout than your less-agreeable colleagues. 


      ![Picture "Grey Lines with Black, Blue and Yellow" by Georgia O'Keeffe](/assets/uploads/screenshot-2024-03-19-at-11.48.04.png "“Grey Lines with Black, Blue and Yellow” by Georgia O'Keeffe (1923). “I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life – and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.” O'Keffe wrote that colour was 'one of the great things in the world that makes life worth living'. Studying colours could be surprisingly helpful in calming stressful thoughts and creating 'space' in the mind. Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, USA. © Georgie O'Keeffe Museum/DACS 2022. Museum purchase funded by the Agnes Cullen Arnold Endowment Fund/Bridgeman Images.")


      **Neuroticism** or *emotional instability* is the tendency to *experience strong emotions* such as *fear, anxiety, sadness, embarrassment, anger, guilt* and *disgust*. A high score in neuroticism mean you often *feel vulnerable, have difficulties to control impulses* and *coping poorly with stress*. A low neuroticism score means you are emotionally stable – usually calm, contented, relaxed and resilient. As you probably guessed, more emotionally stable person is less likely to suffer from burnout and vice versa.


      ##### Locus of control


      > Meet Hannah, a customer support pro who believes client satisfaction is a result of her actions. Every challenge is a chance to learn, reflect, and proactively improve for the future. This commitment to growth earns her a stream of positive feedback from customers.

      >

      > Conversely, her colleague Maria, thinks, *"If people are upset, it's their problem"*. Feeling helpless, unlucky, and consistently dealing with tough clients. Maria believes she's got all the skills and sees no need for improvement of her communication.


      The **locus of control** is the degree to which we believe our actions, as opposed to external factors, shape our lives. Developed by psychologist Julian B. Rotter in 1954, it's a spectrum from *internal* to *external* locus of control.


      Hannah has a strong internal locus of control, attributing events to her actions. Maria's belief in external factors driving outcomes showcases an external locus of control.


      A heightened external locus of control increases the likelihood of experiencing burnout, particularly in uncertain or unfamiliar situations where we feel we lack control even more.


      ##### Expectations


      People's work expectations directly affect burnout levels: striving for higher goals often results in increased effort, yet it can also lead to emotional exhaustion and detachment from work.


      The person’s level of involvement, specifically, over-involvement is also a potential trigger, especially when it may be impossible to achieve goals. 


      This mismatch between expectations and realities can lead to frustration and burnout in people.

      ### **How to recover from burnout?**


      ![Picture "The Japanese Footbridge" by Claude Monet (1899)](/assets/uploads/screenshot-2024-03-19-at-12.54.52.png "“The Japanese Footbridge” by Claude Monet (1899). When political problems in France affected society, Monet withdrew and began painting what comforted him: the peace, beauty and calm of his garden. Gardens had always offered him a refuge from the world. In 1893 he purchased plot of land close to his home and transformed it into a water garden. All was places or grown to create the most harmonious views, and the water, vegetation and muted colours created a quiet, meditative atmosphere. He painted it in different seasons and at different times of day. National Gallery of Art, Washington/Gift of Victoria Nebeker Coberly, in memory of her son John W. Rudd, and Walter H. and Lenore Annenberg.")


      * I took a **vacation**, in my case, when physical health was already suffering, I couldn't manage without it.

      * I **prioritized** **sleep**. Started going to bed by 11 pm, and tried to finish all entertainment and gatherings with friends by 9:30 pm. I say openly about when I want it to end (New Year's Eve was an exception).

        Two hours before bedtime, I turn off the bright white light and turn on warm night lamps. All screens are switched to night mode.

        I ventilate the bedroom and put on a sleep mask and earplugs. The **three basic conditions for good quality sleep are darkness, silence, and coolness.** 
      * I live by the principle – ***"If you're tired, rest."*** I take breaks in the middle of the day to lie on the sofa, hug my husband, watch funny videos, play with my cat Sima and dog Jamie, drink tea, meditate, water flowers, etc.

      * I finish all work (consultations, supervision, training, creating posts, stories) by 6:00 pm, **even if I didn't do everything I planned**. I don't take new trainings if I feel a lack of energy.

      * I don't like **physical exercises**, but I'm sleepy and irritable without them. I used to force myself to jog, but that didn't bring me joy either. 

        I found my favorite yoga asanas and added a little warm-up instead. It takes only **15-20 minutes** in the morning and this is just enough to release **serotonin** – a neurotransmitter that affects your mood, appetite and helps regulate sleep-wake cycles and the body clock. 

        Once, instead of exercising, my husband suggested playing a Twister game, so I will tell you that it's not worse than asanas and even funnier. 

        Every day I go for **a walk for at least 30 minutes**, I try not to use the elevator, and I walk when I talk on the phone. Sometimes I brush my teeth while standing on one leg (asana for balance). And since summer I appreciated cycling.
      * Thanks to my husband, I **added** **more variety to my everyday life**: I started cooking new recipes. I learned (well, it was said out loud) to play poker and munchkin, thanks to my friends. I bought myself different types of flowers and started to experiment with style. Finally, we hung up the bird feeder, not even four years had passed since we created it. I saw a retro train. And in general, there is more spontaneity.

      * **I choose people who choose me.** I spend more time with people with whom I feel good and minimize communication with those who drain my energy. I'm open to meeting new people, so don't hesitate to contact me if you feel up to it.

      * I practice an **information detox**: I don't take my phone with me on weekends or during walks. I rarely read the news, there is not much of a positive, but enough disturbing texts. If I am tired and have some missing calls, I respond that I will call later, unless it is something urgent.
