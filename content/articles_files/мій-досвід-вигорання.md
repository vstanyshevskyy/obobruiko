      > «Вигорання? Це не про мене» - думала я.


      Поки не захворіла на ГРВІ тричі за два місяці. Поки не помітила, що до середи вже втомлююсь працювати, стало важко сконцентруватись, з’явилася забудькуватість (одного разу машину забула закрити), легше дратуюсь, більше тривожусь, гірше сплю, прокрастиную і не маю сил та бажання пробувати щось нове.


      За захопленням від роботи, я **довгий час не помічала втоми**. Забула як це відпочивати і не думати про роботу. А без якісного відпочинку ставало все важче і важче працювати.


      Так я застрягла у циклі вигорання.


      ## Як я вибиралась звідти?


      1. Зробила собі відпустку, у моєму випадку, коли вже страждало фізичне здоров’я, без цього було не обійтись.

      2. Пріоритезувала сон, почала лягати до 23-ї і всі розваги та посиденьки з друзями намагаюсь завершувати до 21:30. Відверто говорю про те, коли хочу завершити (Новий рік, то був виняток). За 2 години до сну вимикаю яскраве біле світло, в хід ідуть теплі нічники і торшерчики. Усі екрани переведені в нічний режим. Провітрюю спальню, вдягаю маску для сну і беруші. Бо **три базові умови для якісного сну – це темнота, тишина і прохолода**. У вихідні намагаюсь вставати до 9-ї, але можу і полежати в ліжечку, якщо цього потребую. 

      3. Живу за принципом – **«втомилася, відпочинь»**. Роблю «привали» посеред дня, щоб полежати на диванчику, обійняти чоловіка, глянути смішні відео, погратися з котом, зробити чайок, помедитувати, полити квіти і т.д.

      4. Завершую усі робочі справи (консультації, супервізії, навчання, створення постів, сторіс) до 18:00, **навіть якщо не встигла зробити щось із запланованого**. Не беру нових навчань, якщо не вистачає сил.

      5. Я не дуже люблю фізичні вправи, але без них я сонна і зла. Раніше змушувала себе бігати, але то не моє. Знайшла для себе улюблені асани з йоги і трішки зарядки, **усього 15-20 хв зранку**, цього якраз достатньо для виділення серотоніну. Одного разу, замість вправ, чоловік запропонував пограти в твістер, то я вам скажу не гірше асан. Щодня виходжу на прогулянку мінімум на 30 хв, не користуюсь ліфтом, ходжу коли говорю по телефону. Іноді чищу зуби, стоячи на одній нозі (асана на баланс). А влітку зацінила велосипед.

      6. **Додала різноманіття**: почала ходити в нові заклади і готувати нові рецепти, дякуючи чоловіку. Навчилась (ну це голосно сказано) грати в покер і манчкін, дякуючи подругам. Купила різні квіти. Дозволила собі експериментувати зі стилем. Нарешті повісили з чоловіком годівничку для птахів, не пройшло й чотирьох років. Побачила ретропотяг. І загалом стало більше спонтанності.

      7. Більше проводжу часу з людьми, з якими почуваюсь добре і мінімізувала спілкування з тими, хто висмоктує сили. Відкритіша до спілкування з новими людьми.

      8. Роблю **інформаційний детокс**: у вихідні дні не беру з собою телефон (довелось сертифікат про вакцинацію скинути чоловіку), рідко читаю новини, позитиву там не дуже, а тривожних текстів достатньо. Якщо втомлена і маю пропущені дзвінки, то пишу, що зателефоную пізніше, якщо це не щось термінове.


      Ось такий він, мій рецепт «розгорання». А який у вас? Як ви справляєтесь з вигоранням і додаєте собі ресурсів?

      Until I caught a cold 3 times in 2 months.


      Until I was getting tired of work by Wednesday.


      Until it became difficult to concentrate.


      Until I became forgetful (once I forgot to lock the car), irritable, and worried.


      Until my sleep worsened.


      Until I procrastinated most of the time and didn't have the energy or desire to try anything new.


      I didn't notice exhaustion behind my enthusiasm for work for a long time. I forgot what it's like to relax and not think about work. And without quality rest, it became harder and harder to work.


      That's how I got stuck in a burnout cycle.


      I've really dived into understanding burnout. Through professional courses and extensive research, I've gained some valuable insights into what exactly burnout is and how you can either cope with it or, even better, prevent it altogether. Let's dive into it together.

      ### What is burnout?


      The World Health Organization describes [burnout syndrome](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases) as an individual **“response to chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed”**. Burnout is not a medical condition or mental disorder, but it can cause damage at a cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral level, which translates into a negative attitude towards work, colleagues, clients, and the professional role itself.


      ![Picture "Furious Man" by Jean-Michel Basquiat (1982)](/assets/uploads/furious-man-by-jean-michel-basquiat.png "\\"Furious Man\\" by Jean-Michel Basquiat (1982). When painting with intensity, the Basquiat's mind enters a state of flow akin to meditation. This simple psychological technique offers rapid stress relief: immerse yourself so deeply in an absorbing activity that it distracts you from whatever is bothering you. Private collection. © The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat/ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2022")


      [Graham Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene) was the first author who used the term burnout in his novel [“A Burnt-Out Case”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Burnt-Out_Case) in 1961 when describing the story of an architect who found neither meaning in his profession nor pleasure in life.


      Later, this term was picked up by American psychologist [Herbert Freudenberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Freudenberger), who observed the volunteer staff (including himself) at a free clinic for people with drug use issues. He defined [burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout) **as exhaustion, fatigue, and frustration resulting from work's excessive demands and physical symptoms such as headaches and sleeplessness, "quickness to anger", and closed thinking.**


      - - -


      ### Burnout symptoms and signs


      Burnout isn't just about feeling tired or overworked. It can have many signs, but three key dimensions help to differentiate burnout from other conditions:


      * **feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, both emotional and physical;**

      * **feeling disconnected, negative, or cynical towards your job;**

      * **reduced sense of professional efficacy**


      Burnout is often mistaken for stress and, in severe cases, can even develop into depression. So, how can you tell if you or someone close to you is experiencing burnout? Keep an eye out for these signs:


      #### Exhaustion


      You might experience *a lack of emotional and physical energy* for your daily tasks. Work might leave you *emotionally drained and used up* at the end of the day. You might find yourself *tired already in the morning* when you have to face another day on the job. 


      Self-control issues, such as *emotional outbursts or uncontrollable expenses*, could arise. Coping through food, drugs, or alcohol may occur. 


      Look out for symptoms like *low mood, increased anxiety, unexplained physical pain, stomach or bowel issues,* and *difficulty concentrating*, as they may indicate fatigue.


      #### Job disconnection and negativity


      You may witness a *decline in interest and enthusiasm for your work*. 


      Experience *impatience*, or *irritability* t*oward your co-workers, customers, or clients*. Prefer to focus solely on tasks *without social interaction* with your colleagues. 


      You might encounter *negative thoughts* or *make cynical remarks/jokes* about yourself, work, and colleagues.


      Additionally, you might feel *dissatisfaction with work outcomes* and their significance.


      #### Reduced performance


      You might feel *ineffective* in problem-solving, disconnected from the organization's goals, and that you are *lacking a sense of accomplishment* in your job. 


      *Doubts about your* *competence and effectiveness* in getting tasks done may arise.

      ### Consequences of burnout


      Burnout doesn't go away on its own. It worsens unless you address the root causes. Ignoring burnout symptoms could damage your physical and mental health even more. Besides, you could also lose your ability to meet job demands effectively which could negatively affect other areas of your life.  


      #### Mental health consequences


      In different studies burnout is associated with: 


      * *Concentration and memory issues* 

      * *Difficulties with decision-making*

      * *Decreased ability to handle life events*

      * *Anxiety*

      * *Depression*

      * *Dissatisfaction with life*

      * *Low self-esteem*

      * *Insomnia*

      * *Irritability*


      Other researchers indicate that burnout can pose *a significant suicide risk*.


      ![Picture "Red Balloon" by Paul Klee](/assets/uploads/red-balloon-by-paul-klee.jpg "\\"Red Balloon\\" by Paul Klee (1922). Klee's home was ransacked by the Gestapo, he was fired from Düsseldorf Academy and many of his paintings were seized. In 1933 he began suffering with a painful illness, yet he managed to produce more than 1000 works during his final years, many dealing with his personal stress. Klee used the process of making art as meditation, saying that it helped him to live in an 'intermediate world'. A phenomenon known as 'Post-Traumatic Growth' is where people who have suffered extreme stress use the experience to enhanced appreciate life and also learn to embrace new opportunities, cultivating inner strength through the knowledge that they have overcome tremendous hardship.

      #### Physical health consequences


      Several studies conclude that individuals with a higher degree of burnout are more likely to experience: *muscle pain, gastrointestinal issues, headaches, cardiovascular disorders, increased vulnerability to infections, insomnia and chronic fatigue*.


      Additionally, burnout can *dangerously elevate blood cortisol levels* and is a *risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes*.


      These symptoms can show up differently in different people, and not everyone will experience all of them.


      #### Behavioral consequences


      Burnout can lead to:


      * *Feeling unhappy or dissatisfied with work*

      * *Losing interest or commitment to your job*

      * *Being absent from work a lot or being present but not really doing your tasks because of health issues*

      * *Thinking about quitting your job*

      * *Not being able to work as effectively as before*

      * *Feeling more aggressive towards coworkers or clients*

      * *Drinking more alcohol or smoking more*

      * *Misusing company resources, or even stealing from work*


      - - -


      ### The causes of burnout


      Two primarily categories that can trigger burnout are *organizational* and *individual* factors. 


      > **Key point:** burnout is more a result of workplace conditions than individual characteristics. Although organizational factors are capable per se of generating burnout, individual factors would play a moderating role.


      ![Picture "The Escape Ladder" by Joan Miró](/assets/uploads/the-escape-ladder-by-joan-miro.png "\\"The Escape Ladder\\" by Joan Miró (1940). Miró became an accountant to please his parents, but the stress of being in a career that he disliked proved too much; art helped him to become self-aware and to understand his thought processes. Whatever the cause of the stress, by visualising personal thought processes objectively, one can learn to take more control. Albricht-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, USA © Successió Miró/ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2022. Bridgeman Images.")


      #### Organizational factors


      Usually, the type of work you do, how it's organized, and how you get along with your coworkers, supervisors, and/or clients can all be potential triggers or risk factors for burnout.


      ##### Work overload


      Having too much work, both in quantity and complexity, requires significant effort and can make you feel exhausted and stressed out. It might even make you want to distance yourself from work to protect yourself from feeling even worse.


      ##### Poor working hours


      A work schedule that hinders your work-life balance is another trigger of burnout, especially when dealing with: *shift work, frequent rotations, night shifts, extended working* hours or *excessive overtime.*


      Additionally, these demanding schedules are linked to *sleep disorders, heart issues,* *health complaints, job dissatisfaction, decreased attention* and *performance*, and an increased *risk of accidents*.


      ##### Emotional labor


      > *Imagine a situation when Hannah that works at customer support soothes an angry client who is not satisfied with their purchase. This is an example of emotional labor – the process of managing your feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of your job.* 


      Employees often need to control their emotions when interacting with customers, coworkers, and managers. This means suppressing feelings like anger, irritation, or discomfort to follow company guidelines. It also involves expressing emotions that might not be genuine, such as showing sympathy to clients or smiling to coworkers. Sometimes, it means appearing calm even when feeling scared.


      Dealing with emotional labor often means handling extra stress at work. Several studies have found strong connections between emotional labor and burnout, particularly in fields like teaching and human resources.


      ##### Lack of autonomy and influence at work


      Lack of freedom at in how you do your job, and the inability to influence decisions that affect your work are linked to increased burnout. On the flip side, having autonomy and control over your work can lower burnout levels and increase professional satisfaction.


      ##### Ambiguity and role conflict


      When you're not sure what's expected of you or your role isn't clear enough, or when your tasks clash or create conflicting demands, burnout level increases.


      ##### Incompetent supervision and unfair treatment


      Overly controlling and unjust supervision, fixated solely on mistakes without acknowledging achievements and efforts, or the opposite – complete lack of direction or having no clear leadership at all, increases the likelihood of burnout. 


      On the other hand, when employees are treated fairly, it leads to an increase in available resources, which helps to reduce emotional exhaustion and lowers the risk of burnout.


      ##### Lack of social support


      Lack of support from colleagues or supervisors at work, along with internal conflicts among coworkers, can trigger burnout. Conversely, having social support acts as a buffer against this syndrome.


      #### Individual factors


      ##### Personality traits


      Your personality affects how you perceive work environment, how you cope and manage with work demands and resources.


      One popular model of personality is [the Big Five](https://bigfive-test.com) model. This model represents five major personality traits that you can remember using OCEAN acronym:


      * **\*O**penness *vs.* closedness to experience* 

      * **\*C**onscientiousness *vs.* lack of direction*

      * **\*E**xtraversion *vs.* introversion*

      * **\*A**greeableness *vs.* antagonism*

      * **\*N**euroticism *vs.* emotional stability*


      Several studies conclude that personality traits in the Big Five model are significantly and differently associated with burnout. 


      **Openness to experience** means you're *curios* about both *inner* and *outer* *worlds*, *creative*, have *active imagination*, *wide interests* and *willingness to consider new ideas*. If you score high on openness it will be a protective factor against burnout as it is positively associated with the professional efficacy component of burnout and negatively associated with job disconnection.


      Likewise, **conscientiousness** that describes *careful, organized, thorough, efficient, self-disciplined* and *determined* person, reduces the likelihood of burnout.


      If you're more of an **extravert** – *sociable, outgoing, energetic, adventurous* and *enthusiastic* – consider yourself lucky as extraversion is another personality trait that protects you against burnout.


      Similarly, if you're more-**agreeable** person who is *altruistic, trustful, sympathetic* to others and *eager to help* them, you will tend to experience less burnout than your less-agreeable colleagues. 


      ![Picture "Grey Lines with Black, Blue and Yellow" by Georgia O'Keeffe](/assets/uploads/screenshot-2024-03-19-at-11.48.04.png "\\"Grey Lines with Black, Blue and Yellow\\" by Georgia O'Keeffe (1923). \\"I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life – and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.\\" O'Keffe wrote that colour was 'one of the great things in the world that makes life worth living'. Studying colours could be surprisingly helpful in calming stressful thoughts and creating 'space' in the mind. Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, USA. © Georgie O'Keeffe Museum/DACS 2022. Museum purchase funded by the Agnes Cullen Arnold Endowment Fund/Bridgeman Images.")


      **Neuroticism** or *emotional instability* is the tendency to *experience strong emotions* such as *fear, anxiety, sadness, embarrassment, anger, guilt* and *disgust*. A high score in neuroticism mean you often *feel vulnerable, have difficulties to control impulses* and *coping poorly with stress*. A low neuroticism score means you are emotionally stable – usually calm, contented, relaxed and resilient. As you probably guessed, more emotionally stable person is less likely to suffer from burnout and vice versa.


      ##### Locus of control


      > Meet Hannah, a customer support pro who believes client satisfaction is a result of her actions. Every challenge is a chance to learn, reflect, and proactively improve for the future. This commitment to growth earns her a stream of positive feedback from customers.

      >

      > Conversely, her colleague Maria, thinks, *"If people are upset, it's their problem"*. Feeling helpless, unlucky, and consistently dealing with tough clients. Maria believes she's got all the skills and sees no need for improvement of her communication.


      The **locus of control** is the degree to which we believe our actions, as opposed to external factors, shape our lives. Developed by psychologist Julian B. Rotter in 1954, it's a spectrum from *internal* to *external* locus of control.


      Hannah has a strong internal locus of control, attributing events to her actions. Maria's belief in external factors driving outcomes showcases an external locus of control.


      A heightened external locus of control increases the likelihood of experiencing burnout, particularly in uncertain or unfamiliar situations where we feel we lack control even more.


      ##### Expectations


      People's work expectations directly affect burnout levels: striving for higher goals often results in increased effort, yet it can also lead to emotional exhaustion and detachment from work.


      The person’s level of involvement, specifically, over-involvement is also a potential trigger, especially when it may be impossible to achieve goals. 


      This mismatch between expectations and realities can lead to frustration and burnout in people.

      ### **How to recover from burnout?**


      ![Picture "The Japanese Footbridge" by Claude Monet (1899)](/assets/uploads/screenshot-2024-03-19-at-12.54.52.png "\\"The Japanese Footbridge\\" by Claude Monet (1899). When political problems in France affected society, Monet withdrew and began painting what comforted him: the peace, beauty and calm of his garden. Gardens had always offered him a refuge from the world. In 1893 he purchased plot of land close to his home and transformed it into a water garden. All was places or grown to create the most harmonious views, and the water, vegetation and muted colours created a quiet, meditative atmosphere. He painted it in different seasons and at different times of day. National Gallery of Art, Washington/Gift of Victoria Nebeker Coberly, in memory of her son John W. Rudd, and Walter H. and Lenore Annenberg.")


      * I took a vacation, in my case, when physical health was already suffering, I couldn't do without it.

      * I **prioritized** **sleep**. Started going to bed by 11 pm, and tried to finish all entertainment and gatherings with friends by 9:30 pm. I say openly about when I want it to end (New Year's Eve was an exception).

        Two hours before bedtime, I turn off the bright white light and turn on warm night lamps. All screens are switched to night mode.

        I ventilate the bedroom and put on a sleep mask and earplugs. The **three basic conditions for good quality sleep are darkness, silence, and coolness.** 
      * I live by the principle – ***"If you're tired, rest."*** I take breaks in the middle of the day to lie on the sofa, hug my husband, watch funny videos, play with my cat Sima and dog Jamie, drink tea, meditate, water flowers, etc.

      * I finish all work (consultations, supervision, training, creating posts, stories) by 6:00 pm, **even if I didn't do everything I planned**. I don't take new trainings if I feel a lack of energy.

      * I don't like **physical exercises**, but I'm sleepy and irritable without them. I used to force myself to jog, but that didn't bring me joy either. 

        I found my favorite yoga asanas and added a little warm-up instead. It takes only **15-20 minutes** in the morning and this is just enough to release **serotonin** – a neurotransmitter that affects your mood, appetite and helps regulate sleep-wake cycles and the body clock. 

        Once, instead of exercising, my husband suggested playing a Twister game, so I will tell you that it's not worse than asanas and even funnier. 

        Every day I go for **a walk for at least 30 minutes**, I try not to use the elevator, and I walk when I talk on the phone. Sometimes I brush my teeth while standing on one leg (asana for balance). And since summer I appreciated cycling.
      * Thanks to my husband, I **added** **more variety to my everyday life**: I started cooking new recipes. I learned (well, it was said out loud) to play poker and munchkin, thanks to my friends. I bought myself different types of flowers and started to experiment with style. Finally, we hung up the bird feeder, not even four years had passed since we created it. I saw a retro train. And in general, there is more spontaneity.

      * **I choose people who choose me.** I spend more time with people with whom I feel good and minimize communication with those who drain my energy. I'm open to meeting new people, so don't hesitate to contact me if you feel up to it.

      * I practice an **information detox**: I don't take my phone with me on weekends or during walks. I rarely read the news, there is not much of a positive, but enough disturbing texts. If I am tired and have some missing calls, I respond that I will call later, unless it is something urgent.


      Here it is, my recipe for "burning up", hope you find it helpful. If you like my article I would be grateful if you share it with your friends
