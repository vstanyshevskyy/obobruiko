      An unexpected meeting appears on your calendar. A recruiter stops
      replying. A loved one doesn’t answer a message for hours.


      Nothing bad has happened – yet. Still, your mind races, filling in the blanks, often with the most unsettling explanations.


       Unexpected events – pandemics, wars, recessions, layoffs – can leave even the most resilient people feeling unmoored. At the same time, many of life’s most meaningful moments also emerge from uncertainty. We don’t know where we’ll meet a future partner, when an opportunity will arise, or what will happen when we take a risk.


      The desire for a predictable, safe life is deeply human. We want our loved ones to be healthy, our work stable, and the future manageable. But reality rarely cooperates. We can control only parts of our own lives, have limited influence over those we love, and little control over larger events. No amount of planning can eliminate uncertainty entirely. 


       Uncertainty, then, is not a failure of preparation – it means you’re alive.
