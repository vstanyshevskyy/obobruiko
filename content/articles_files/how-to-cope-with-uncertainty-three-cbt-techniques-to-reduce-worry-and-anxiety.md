      An unexpected meeting appears on your calendar. A recruiter stops
      replying. A loved one doesn’t answer a message for hours.


      Nothing bad has happened – yet. Still, your mind races, filling in the blanks, often with the most unsettling explanations.


       Unexpected events – pandemics, wars, recessions, layoffs – can leave even the most resilient people feeling unmoored. At the same time, many of life’s most meaningful moments also emerge from uncertainty. We don’t know where we’ll meet a future partner, when an opportunity will arise, or what will happen when we take a risk.


      The desire for a predictable, safe life is deeply human. We want our loved ones to be healthy, our work stable, and the future manageable. But reality rarely cooperates. We can control only parts of our own lives, have limited influence over those we love, and little control over larger events. No amount of planning can eliminate uncertainty entirely. 


      Uncertainty isn’t a failure of preparation; it’s simply part of being alive.


      ## Why Uncertainty Feels Threatening


      Uncertainty itself is neutral – it simply means “not knowing.” What makes it feel manageable or overwhelming is how we interpret it.


      Some people move through ambiguity with ease. Others find it deeply unsettling. Most of us fall somewhere in between, and our tolerance shifts depending on the stakes, the context, and the moment.


      When uncertainty feels intolerable, the brain interprets it as danger. The unknown becomes a problem that must be solved immediately, and events that are merely unclear begin to feel threatening.


      Many people cope by trying to eliminate uncertainty – either by increasing control or by avoiding ambiguity entirely.


      ## Trying to Control or Avoid the Unknown


      When faced with uncertainty, many of us try to regain control and make situations more predictable. Psychologists call these *protective behaviors* – strategies intended to reduce anxiety that, paradoxically, often keep it going.


      Examples of **protective behaviors**:


      * **Worrying about every possible outcome.**

         

        *“What if I don’t hear back from the recruiter?” “What if I receive a rejection email?”*
      * **Overpreparing for even minor decisions.**

         Spending hours agonizing over a gift for a colleague or double-checking every detail.
      * **Focusing obsessively on potential threats and exaggerating them.**

         

        *“My manager added a sudden meeting; they must be planning to fire me.”*
      * **Seeking reassurance from others.**

         

        *“Please tell me everything will be okay.”*
      * **Insisting on doing everything yourself.**

         Refusing to share responsibility, convinced only you can do it right.

      **Avoidance** is another common strategy – steering clear of uncertainty entirely. Examples include:


      * **Avoiding full commitment.** Holding back from friendships or romantic relationships because the outcome is not guaranteed.

      * **Declining social invitations or opportunities.** Finding reasons not to participate because the situation might provoke anxiety.

      * **Procrastinating.** Putting off tasks or calls because you cannot predict how they will turn out.


      Both strategies are understandable – and both are exhausting. Over time, they teach the mind that uncertainty is dangerous and that control or avoidance is the only path to safety.


      > **Example: Maya**

      >

      > Maya sees an unexpected meeting with her manager on her calendar. Her mind races: *“What if my manager is unhappy with my work? What if I get fired?”* She spends the day rehearsing every possible scenario, rereading emails, rechecking her work, and drafting talking points “just in case.” That evening, a new friend invites her out – she declines, feeling too unsettled to socialize.

      >

      > Nothing has gone wrong. Yet uncertainty has taken over.

      >

      > Maya is trying to reduce anxiety by increasing certainty: thinking through every possible outcome, preparing excessively, and pulling back from unpredictable situations. While these protective behaviors offer momentary relief, they are exhausting in the long run and reinforce the idea that she cannot cope without certainty.


      ### Why These Strategies Don’t Work


      Protective behaviors and avoidance may calm anxiety briefly, but over time, they reinforce the belief: *I cannot cope unless I eliminate uncertainty.*


      * Overpreparing, rehearsing every scenario, or seeking constant reassurance reinforces the idea that we are fragile without certainty.

      * Avoiding unpredictable situations prevents us from discovering whether the feared outcome would actually occur – or whether we could handle it if it did.


      Intolerance of uncertainty fuels chronic worry. The more we try to control everything or avoid ambiguity, the less confident we feel in handling life’s inevitable challenges. Yet if we look back honestly, we often realize we’ve survived far more than we feared.


      A bit of preparation or caution is wise – but constantly imagining worst-case scenarios deepens worry, narrows our experience, and drains energy.
