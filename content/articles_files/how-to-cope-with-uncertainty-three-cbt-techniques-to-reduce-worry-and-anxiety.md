      An unexpected meeting appears on your calendar. A recruiter stops
      replying. A loved one doesn’t answer a message for hours.


      Nothing bad has happened – yet. Still, your mind races, filling in the blanks, often with the most unsettling explanations.


       Unexpected events – pandemics, wars, recessions, layoffs – can leave even the most resilient people feeling unmoored. At the same time, many of life’s most meaningful moments also emerge from uncertainty. We don’t know where we’ll meet a future partner, when an opportunity will arise, or what will happen when we take a risk.


      The desire for a predictable, safe life is deeply human. We want our loved ones to be healthy, our work stable, and the future manageable. But reality rarely cooperates. We can control only parts of our own lives, have limited influence over those we love, and little control over larger events. No amount of planning can eliminate uncertainty entirely. 


      Uncertainty isn’t a failure of preparation; it’s simply part of being alive.


      ## Why Uncertainty Feels Threatening


      Uncertainty itself is neutral – it simply means “not knowing.” What makes it feel manageable or overwhelming is how we interpret it.


      Some people move through ambiguity with ease. Others find it deeply unsettling. Most of us fall somewhere in between, and our tolerance shifts depending on the stakes, the context, and the moment.


      When uncertainty feels intolerable, the brain interprets it as danger. The unknown becomes a problem that must be solved immediately, and events that are merely unclear begin to feel threatening.


      Many people cope by trying to eliminate uncertainty – either by increasing control or by avoiding ambiguity entirely.


      ## Trying to Control or Avoid the Unknown


      When faced with uncertainty, many of us try to regain control and make situations more predictable. Psychologists call these *protective behaviors* – strategies intended to reduce anxiety that, paradoxically, often keep it going.


      Examples of **protective behaviors**:


      * **Worrying about every possible outcome.**

         

        *“What if I don’t hear back from the recruiter?” “What if I receive a rejection email?”*
      * **Overpreparing for even minor decisions.**

         Spending hours agonizing over a gift for a colleague or double-checking every detail.
      * **Focusing obsessively on potential threats and exaggerating them.**

         

        *“My manager added a sudden meeting; they must be planning to fire me.”*
      * **Seeking reassurance from others.**

         

        *“Please tell me everything will be okay.”*
      * **Insisting on doing everything yourself.**

         Refusing to share responsibility, convinced only you can do it right.

      **Avoidance** is another common strategy – steering clear of uncertainty entirely. Examples include:


      * **Avoiding full commitment.** Holding back from friendships or romantic relationships because the outcome is not guaranteed.

      * **Declining social invitations or opportunities.** Finding reasons not to participate because the situation might provoke anxiety.

      * **Procrastinating.** Putting off tasks or calls because you cannot predict how they will turn out.


      Both strategies are understandable – and both are exhausting. Over time, they teach the mind that uncertainty is dangerous and that control or avoidance is the only path to safety.


      > **Example: Maya**

      >

      > Maya sees an unexpected meeting with her manager on her calendar. Her mind races: *“What if my manager is unhappy with my work? What if I get fired?”* She spends the day rehearsing every possible scenario, rereading emails, rechecking her work, and drafting talking points “just in case.” That evening, a new friend invites her out – she declines, feeling too unsettled to socialize.

      >

      > Nothing has gone wrong. Yet uncertainty has taken over.

      >

      > Maya is trying to reduce anxiety by increasing certainty: thinking through every possible outcome, preparing excessively, and pulling back from unpredictable situations. While these protective behaviors offer momentary relief, they are exhausting in the long run and reinforce the idea that she cannot cope without certainty.


      ### Why These Strategies Don’t Work


      Protective behaviors and avoidance may calm anxiety briefly, but over time, they reinforce the belief: *I cannot cope unless I eliminate uncertainty.*


      * Overpreparing, rehearsing every scenario, or seeking constant reassurance reinforces the idea that we are fragile without certainty.

      * Avoiding unpredictable situations prevents us from discovering whether the feared outcome would actually occur – or whether we could handle it if it did.


      Intolerance of uncertainty fuels chronic worry. The more we try to control everything or avoid ambiguity, the less confident we feel in handling life’s inevitable challenges. Yet if we look back honestly, we often realize we’ve survived far more than we feared.


      A bit of preparation or caution is wise – but constantly imagining worst-case scenarios deepens worry, narrows our experience, and drains energy.


      ## What Psychology Suggests Instead


      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most well-researched approaches for managing anxiety. Rather than trying to eliminate uncertainty – an impossible task – CBT helps people change how they relate to it.


      Three CBT tools are especially helpful:


      1. **Recognizing distorted thinking** –spotting how your mind exaggerates threats or interprets events negatively.

      2. **Distinguishing helpful vs. unhelpful worry** –identifying worries that help solve problems versus those that trap you in loops.

      3. **Gradually increasing tolerance for uncertainty** – practicing being in situations with unknown outcomes so the mind learns that ambiguity is manageable – and sometimes even positive.


      ## Technique 1: Recognizing the Thinking Errors That Shape Anxiety


      Psychologists call repeated, automatic thinking mistakes *cognitive distortions*. First described by the psychiatrist Aaron Beck, these patterns show how our minds misread reality – especially when under stress.


      Cognitive distortions often sneak in so fast we barely notice them. They feel like automatic conclusions: *“This is bad,” “I’ve failed,” or “Something terrible is about to happen.”*


      ### Common Cognitive Distortions


      **Catastrophizing**


      Jumping to the worst possible outcome, even with little or no evidence. Catastrophizing ignores the many neutral or manageable possibilities in between. A small problem becomes a disaster.


      * Your partner says they want to talk, and the mind jumps ahead: *They will break up with me.* 

      * A headache suddenly feels like a serious illness. 


      **Overgeneralization**


      One negative event becomes proof of a permanent pattern.


      * One bad date → “*I’ll always be alone*.”

      * One work mistake → “*I’m terrible at my job*.”


      **All-or-Nothing Thinking**


      Seeing experiences in extremes, leaving no room for nuance.


      * You’re either successful or a failure: “*If I didn’t do this perfectly, I am a loser.”*

      * Either confident or incompetent.

      * Either liked or rejected. 


      **Emotional Thinking**


      Treating feelings as facts. The emotion becomes “evidence”, even when reality suggests otherwise.


      * Feeling anxious → assuming danger is present. 

      * Feeling guilty → assuming you’ve done something wrong. 


      **Mind Reading**


      Assuming you know what others are thinking – usually something negative – without direct evidence.


      * A colleague seems quiet in a meeting → “*They think I’m incompetent*.*”*

      * A delayed reply → interpreted as disinterest or rejection, when the information simply isn’t there.


      **Labeling**


      Taking a single action or mistake and turning it into a global judgment about yourself. Instead of describing what happened, your mind declares who you are.


      * Forgetting to mute yourself during a work meeting → “*I’m stupid*.”

      * Missing a deadline → “*I’m irresponsible*.”


      **Personalization**


      Taking responsibility for events outside your control.


      ·      A partner seems unhappy → *“It must be my fault.”*


      ·      A team project struggles → assuming full responsibility, even when multiple factors are involved.


      **Mental Filtering**: Focusing only on the negative while ignoring the positives.  The mind filters out the broader picture, leaving a distorted impression of failure.


      ·      You receive ten positive comments and one critical one → you remember only the criticism. 


      **Disqualifying the Positive**: Dismissing or explaining away positive experiences.


      ·      Success is attributed to luck, not effort. 


      ·      Praise is seen as politeness. 


      ·      Achievements “don’t count” because they don’t fit your negative story.


      **“Should” Statements**: Rigid rules about how life, people, or relationships “ought” to be. When reality doesn’t match these standards, frustration, shame, or resentment often follows.


      *·      “I should be rich to be successful.”*


      *·      “Parenting should be easy.”*


      ·      *“My manager should promote me.”*


      These are common mental habits, especially when we are tired, stressed, or facing uncertainty. The issue isn’t that these thoughts appear, [](<>)but that we accept them as absolute truth without question.


      **The goal isn’t to eliminate them. Instead, it’s to create a pause –** a space to ask: *“Could there be another way to interpret this?”* It’s in that pause that anxiety begins to lose its grip.
