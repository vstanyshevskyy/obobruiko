      Цінності – це найглибші бажання вашого серця, це те, як би ви хотіли
      прожити своє життя як людина. Цінності це не те, що ви хочете отримати або
      досягти; вони те, як ви хочете вести себе або діяти на постійній основі.


      Є сотні різних цінностей, але нижче ви знайдете список найбільш поширених
      з них. Можливо, не всі з них будуть відноситись до вас. 


      Майте на увазі, що не існує такої речі, як «правильних цінностей» і
      «неправильних цінностей». Це трохи схоже на ваші смаки щодо піцци. Якщо ви
      віддаєте перевагу шинці і ананасам, а я віддаю перевагу ковбасі і оливкам,
      це не означає, що мій смак щодо піцци правильний і у вас неправильний. Це
      означає лише те, що в нас різні смаки. Так само ми можемо мати різні
      цінності.

      Embarking on self-discovery is like navigating a vast sea, where our
      values become the guiding stars that illuminate the way. Just as a
      lighthouse stands tall amidst turbulent waves, our values stand as beacons
      of light in the stormy seas of life, offering clarity and direction.


      Values are the deepest desires of your heart, how you would like to live
      your life as a human being. Values are not what you want to get or
      achieve; they are how you want to behave or act on a consistent basis.


      There are hundreds of different values, but I have for you below a list of
      the most common ones. Perhaps not all of them will apply to you. Remember
      that there is no such thing as "right values" and "wrong values." It's a
      bit like your preferences for pizza. If you prefer ham and pineapple, and
      I prefer sausage and olives, it doesn't mean that my taste in pizza is
      right and yours is wrong. It just means that we have different tastes.
      Similarly, we can have different values.
    options:
      very_important: Very important
      important: Somewhat important
      not_important: Not so important
