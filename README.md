## Development

If you would like to contribute - you're always welcome. Just leave a me a note

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

### Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
cd vpershe
npm run develop
```

### Project and Folder Structure
Vpershe as any other Gatsby project starts in [gatsby-node.js](https://github.com/vstanyshevskyy/vpershe/blob/main/gatsby-node.js). It does the following:
* Prepares the images to be used with Sharp plugins (it resizes and optimizes images)
* We load all the pages and processes them
** we group posts by tags
** for each post and page we trigger `createPage` with page url, `component` - template that will render the page and `context` - some additional params for the component.

#### Pages
Pages folder contains pages. Those are generated by default. No need to trigger them in `gatsby-node.js`
